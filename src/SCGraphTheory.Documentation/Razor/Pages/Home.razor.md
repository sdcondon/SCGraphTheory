The SCGraphTheory set of NuGet packages contain basic graph theory implementations for .NET.
The recommended learning path is as follows:

1. **[Abstractions](abstractions):** This is the recommended first stop.
   It describes the SCGraphTheory.Abstractions package, which contains abstractions for the fundamental elements of graph theory - graphs, vertices and edges.
1. **[Search](search):** Documentation for the SCGraphTheory.Search package.
1. **[Adjacency List](adjacency-list):** Documentation for the SCGraphTheory.AdjacencyList package.
   This package contains a mutable adjacency list graph implementation that implements the interfaces defined in the SCGraphTheory.Abstractions package.
